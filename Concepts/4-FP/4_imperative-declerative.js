console.log("Imperative vs Declerative");
// Imperative code => what to do and how to do
// Declerative code => what to do and what should happen
// Humans are Declerative

// Imperative code
for (let index = 1; index <= 5; index++) {
    console.log(index);

// Declerative code

// JQuery is Imperative
// React is Declerative
